# [unreleased]

- Bumped `spacepackets` to v0.18

## Fixed

- Properly emit a finished indication if the transfer is cancelled for NAKed mode
- Destination handler's `TransactionParams::reset` now resets all fields instead of just two.
  The incomplete reset left stale acknowledged-mode state behind, so a new transaction's Metadata
  PDU was mistaken for a duplicate of an already-processed one and silently dropped, breaking
  every transfer after the first one on a given destination handler instance.
- Source handler's `TransactionParams::reset` had the same issue. A second transaction on the
  same source handler instance could compute its EOF checksum over stale state left behind by the
  first one.
- Metadata-only transactions (e.g. a Proxy Put Request per CCSDS 727.0-B-5 6.1) now correctly
  send and expect an EOF (No error) PDU, as required by 4.6.1.1.9 case (C). The source handler no
  longer tries to checksum a source file that does not exist for this case, and the destination
  handler no longer tries to create or truncate a destination file that was never named.
- `StaticPutRequestCacher::set` now clears the source and destination file names when the new
  request has none. A metadata-only put request after a failed put request inherited the stale
  source file and failed with `FileDoesNotExist`.
- Destination handler no longer panics when a metadata PDU's Message To User TLVs overflow its
  internal buffer. It now returns `DestError::MsgsToUserBufferTooSmall` instead, and the buffer
  was bumped from 1024 to 2048 bytes.
- Destination handler's `lost_segment_handling` now clears a gap that a retransmission exactly
  refills. It used to compare the end of the received segment against the start of the most
  recently received window instead of its end, so such a retransmission matched neither branch
  and the gap stayed in the tracker, causing the destination to re-request data it had already
  written on every NAK round until it hit its NAK limit.
- Destination handler now answers a retransmitted EOF PDU instead of silently reprocessing it.
  Per CFDP 4.7.2 every EOF PDU must be acknowledged, and a retransmission means our previous ACK
  was lost. It used to be handled like a brand new EOF regardless of transaction state, which
  re-ran completion, re-sent a fresh Finished PDU, and restarted its positive ACK procedure on
  every retransmission the sender made.
- Destination handler's `reset` now also clears `lost_segment_tracker`. That field lives outside
  `TransactionParams`, so a transaction cancelled or abandoned while a gap was still open left it
  behind for the next transaction on the same handler instance.

# [v0.3.0] 2025-09-25

- Bumped `spacepackets` to v0.16
- Bumped `defmt` to v1

## Added

- Acknowledged mode support for both source and destination handler.
- `FaultInfo` structure which is passed to user fault callbacks.

# [v0.2.0] 2024-11-26

- Bumped `thiserror` to v2
- Bumped `spacepackets` to v0.13
- The source and destination handlers can now be used without the `std` feature and only require
  the `alloc` feature.
