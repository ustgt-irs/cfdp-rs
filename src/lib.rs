//! # `cfdp` - High-level support for implementing CFDP
//!
//! This is a high-level support library for implementing the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol
//! according to the CCSDS 727.0-B-5 standard.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! `cfdp-rs` currently supports following high-level features:
//!
//! - Unacknowledged (class 1) file transfers for both source and destination side.
//! - Acknowledged (class 2) file transfers for both source and destination side.
//!
//! The following features have not been implemented yet. PRs or notifications for demand are welcome!
//!
//! - Suspending transfers
//! - Inactivity handling
//! - Start and end of transmission and reception opportunity handling
//! - Keep Alive and Prompt PDU handling
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The basic idea of CFDP is to convert files of any size into a stream of packets called packet
//! data units (PDU). CFPD has an unacknowledged and acknowledged mode, with the option to request
//! a transaction closure for the unacknowledged mode. Using the unacknowledged mode with no
//! transaction closure is applicable for simplex communication paths, while the unacknowledged
//! mode with closure is the easiest way to get a confirmation of a successful file transfer,
//! including a CRC check on the remote side to verify file integrity. The acknowledged mode is
//! the most complex mode which includes multiple mechanism to ensure succesfull packet transaction
//! even for unreliable connections, including lost segment detection. As such, it can be compared
//! to a specialized TCP for file transfers with remote systems.
//!
//! The goal of this library is to be flexible enough to support the use-cases of both on-board
//! software and of ground software. It has support to make integration on [std] systems as simple
//! as possible, but also has sufficient abstraction to allow for integration on `no_std`
//! environments and can be used on these systems as well.
//!
//! The core handlers inside this library do not allocate memory dynamically. The internal buffer
//! size used for PDU generation and checksum calculation is statically determined via a Rust
//! feature and defaults to 2048 bytes.
//!
//! The core of this library are the [crate::dest::DestinationHandler] and the
//! [crate::source::SourceHandler] components which model the CFDP destination and source entity
//! respectively. You can find high-level and API documentation for both handlers in the respective
//! [crate::dest] and [crate::source] module.
//!
//! # Rust Features
//!
//! ## Default features
//!
//!  - [`std`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/): Enables functionality relying on the standard library.
//!  - [`alloc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/): Enables features which require allocation support.
//!    Enabled by the `std` feature.
//!
//! ## Optional Features
//!
//!  - [`serde`](https://serde.rs/): Adds `serde` support for most types by adding `Serialize` and `Deserialize` `derive`s
//!  - [`defmt`](https://defmt.ferrous-systems.com/): Add support for the `defmt` by adding the
//!    [`defmt::Format`](https://defmt.ferrous-systems.com/format) derive on many types.
//!
//! ## Buffer size selection
//!
//! The following features can be used to select the internal buffer size used for PDU generation
//! and checksum calculation. Selection of this value possibly limits the size of the generated PDU
//! packets. Only one feature may be enabled.
//!
//! - `packet-buf-256` for 256 bytes
//! - `packet-buf-512` for 512 bytes
//! - `packet-buf-1k` for 1024 bytes
//! - `packet-buf-2k` for 2048 bytes. This is the default.
//! - `packet-buf-4k` for 4096 bytes
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! This library currently features two example application which showcase how the provided
//! components could be used to provide CFDP services.
//!
//! The [end-to-end test](https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/rust/cfdp/src/branch/main/tests/end-to-end.rs)
//! is an integration tests which spawns a CFDP source entity and a CFDP destination entity,
//! moves them to separate threads and then performs a small file copy operation.
//! You can run the integration test for a transfer with no closure and with printout to the
//! standard console by running:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test end_to_end_test_no_closure -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! or with closure:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test end_to_end_test_with_closure -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! The [Python Interoperability](https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/rust/cfdp/src/branch/main/examples/python-interop)
//! example showcases the interoperability of the CFDP handlers written in Rust with a Python
//! implementation. The dedicated example documentation shows how to run this example.
//!
//! # Notes on the user hooks and scheduling
//!
//! Both examples feature implementations of the [UserFaultHook] and the [user::CfdpUser]
//! trait which simply print some information to the console to monitor the progress of a file
//! copy operation. These implementations could be adapted for other handler integrations. For
//! example, they could signal a GUI application to display some information for the user.
//!
//! Even though both examples move the newly spawned handlers to dedicated threads, this is not
//! the only way they could be scheduled. For example, to support an arbitrary (or bounded)
//! amount of file copy operations on either source or destination side, those handlers could be
//! moved into a [std::collections::HashMap] structure which is then scheduled inside a thread, or
//! you could schedule a fixed amount of handlers inside a
//! [threadpool](https://docs.rs/threadpool/latest/threadpool/).

/// A generic trait which allows CFDP entities to create check timers which are required to
/// implement special procedures in unacknowledged transmission mode, as specified in 4.6.3.2
/// and 4.6.3.3.
///
/// This trait also allows the creation of different check timers depending on context and purpose
/// of the timer, the runtime environment (e.g. standard clock timer vs. timer using a RTC) or
/// other factors.
///
/// The countdown timer is used by 3 mechanisms of the CFDP protocol.
///
/// ## 1. Check limit handling
///
/// The first mechanism is the check limit handling for unacknowledged transfers as specified
/// in 4.6.3.2 and 4.6.3.3 of the CFDP standard.
/// For this mechanism, the timer has different functionality depending on whether
/// the using entity is the sending entity or the receiving entity for the unacknowledged
/// transmission mode.
///
/// For the sending entity, this timer determines the expiry period for declaring a check limit
/// fault after sending an EOF PDU with requested closure. This allows a timeout of the transfer.
/// Also see 4.6.3.2 of the CFDP standard.
///
/// For the receiving entity, this timer determines the expiry period for incrementing a check
/// counter after an EOF PDU is received for an incomplete file transfer. This allows out-of-order
/// reception of file data PDUs and EOF PDUs. Also see 4.6.3.3 of the CFDP standard.
///
/// ## 2. NAK activity limit
///
/// The timer will be used to perform the NAK activity check as specified in 4.6.4.7 of the CFDP
/// standard. The expiration period will be provided by the NAK timer expiration limit of the
/// remote entity configuration.
///
/// ## 3. Positive ACK procedures
///
/// The timer will be used to perform the Positive Acknowledgement Procedures as specified in
/// 4.7. 1of the CFDP standard. The expiration period will be provided by the Positive ACK timer
/// interval of the remote entity configuration.
pub trait TimerCreator {
    type Countdown: Countdown;

    fn create_countdown(&self, timer_context: TimerContext) -> Self::Countdown;
}

/// This structure models the remote entity configuration information as specified in chapter 8.3
/// of the CFDP standard.
///
/// Some of the fields which were not considered necessary for the Rust implementation
/// were omitted. Some other fields which are not contained inside the standard but are considered
/// necessary for the Rust implementation are included.
///
/// ## Notes on Positive Acknowledgment Procedures
///
/// The `positive_ack_timer_interval_seconds` and `positive_ack_timer_expiration_limit` will
/// be used for positive acknowledgement procedures as specified in CFDP chapter 4.7. The sending
/// entity will start the timer for any PDUs where an acknowledgment is required (e.g. EOF PDU).
/// Once the expected ACK response has not been received for that interval, as counter will be
/// incremented and the timer will be reset. Once the counter exceeds the
/// `positive_ack_timer_expiration_limit`, a Positive ACK Limit Reached fault will be declared.
///
/// ## Notes on Deferred Lost Segment Procedures
///
/// This procedure will be active if an EOF (No Error) PDU is received in acknowledged mode. After
/// issuing the NAK sequence which has the whole file scope, a timer will be started. The timer is
/// reset when missing segments or missing metadata is received. The timer will be deactivated if
/// all missing data is received. If the timer expires, a new NAK sequence will be issued and a
/// counter will be incremented, which can lead to a NAK Limit Reached fault being declared.
///
/// ## Fields
///
/// * `entity_id` - The ID of the remote entity.
/// * `max_packet_len` - This determines of all PDUs generated for that remote entity in addition
///   to the `max_file_segment_len` attribute which also determines the size of file data PDUs.
/// * `max_file_segment_len` The maximum file segment length which determines the maximum size
///   of file data PDUs in addition to the `max_packet_len` attribute. If this field is set
///   to None, the maximum file segment length will be derived from the maximum packet length.
///   If this has some value which is smaller than the segment value derived from
///   `max_packet_len`, this value will be picked.
/// * `closure_requested_by_default` - If the closure requested field is not supplied as part of
///   the Put Request, it will be determined from this field in the remote configuration.
/// * `crc_on_transmission_by_default` - If the CRC option is not supplied as part of the Put
///   Request, it will be determined from this field in the remote configuration.
/// * `default_transmission_mode` - If the transmission mode is not supplied as part of the
///   Put Request, it will be determined from this field in the remote configuration.
/// * `disposition_on_cancellation` - Determines whether an incomplete received file is discard on
///   transaction cancellation. Defaults to False.
/// * `default_crc_type` - Default checksum type used to calculate for all file transmissions to
///   this remote entity.
/// * `check_limit` - This timer determines the expiry period for incrementing a check counter
///   after an EOF PDU is received for an incomplete file transfer. This allows out-of-order
///   reception of file data PDUs and EOF PDUs. Also see 4.6.3.3 of the CFDP standard. Defaults to
///   2, so the check limit timer may expire twice.
/// * `positive_ack_timer_interval_seconds`- See the notes on the Positive Acknowledgment
///   Procedures inside the class documentation. Expected as floating point seconds. Defaults to
///   10 seconds.
/// * `positive_ack_timer_expiration_limit` - See the notes on the Positive Acknowledgment
///   Procedures inside the class documentation. Defaults to 2, so the timer may expire twice.
/// * `immediate_nak_mode` - Specifies whether a NAK sequence should be issued immediately when a
///   file data gap or lost metadata is detected in the acknowledged mode. Defaults to True.
/// * `nak_timer_interval_seconds` -  See the notes on the Deferred Lost Segment Procedure inside
///   the class documentation. Expected as floating point seconds. Defaults to 10 seconds.
/// * `nak_timer_expiration_limit` - See the notes on the Deferred Lost Segment Procedure inside
///   the class documentation. Defaults to 2, so the timer may expire two times.
